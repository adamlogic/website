# The Ember.js View Layer

Ember.js has a sophisticated system for creating, managing and rendering a hierarchy of views that connect to the browser's DOM. Views are responsible for responding to user events, like clicks, drags, and scrolls, as well as updating the contents of the DOM when the data underlying the view changes.

View hierarchies are usually created by evaluating a Handlebars template. As the template is evaluated, child views are added. As the templates for _those_ child views are evaluated, they may have child views added, and so on, until an entire hierarchy is created.

Even if you do not explicitly create child views from your Handlebars templates, Ember.js internally uses the view system to update bound values. For example, every Handlebars expression `{{value}}` creates a view behind-the-scenes that knows how to update the bound value if it changes.

You can also dynamically make changes to the view hierarchy at application runtime using the `Ember.ContainerView` class. Rather than being template-driven, a container view exposes an array of child view instances that can be manually managed.

Views and templates work in tandem to provide a robust system for creating whatever user interface you dream up. End users should be isolated from the complexities of things like timing issues while rendering and event propagation. Application developers should be able to describe their UI once, as a string of Handlebars markup, and then carry on with their application without having to worry about making sure that it remains up-to-date.

## What problems does it solve?

### Child Views

In a typical client-side application, views may represent elements nested inside of each other in the DOM. In the na√Øve solution to this problem, separate view objects represent each DOM element, and ad-hoc references help the various view object keep track of the views conceptually nested inside of them.

Here is a simple example, representing one main app view, a collection nested inside of it, and individual items nested inside of the collection.

This system works well at first glance, but imagine that we want to open Joe's Lamprey Shack at 8am instead of 9am. In this situation, we will want to re-render the App View. Because the developer needed to build up the references to the children on an ad-hoc basis, this re-rendering process has several problems.

In order to re-render the App View, the App View must also manually re-render the child views and re-insert them into App View's element. If implemented perfectly, this process works well, but it relies upon a perfect, ad hoc implementation of a view hierarchy. If any single view fails to implement this precisely, the entire re-render will fail.

In order to avoid these problems, Ember's view hierarchy has the concept of child views baked in.

When the App View re-renders, Ember is responsible for re-rendering and inserting the child views, not application code. This also means that Ember can perform any memory management for you, such as cleaning up observers and bindings.

Not only does this eliminate quite a bit of boilerplate code, but it eliminates the possibility that an imperfectly implemented view hierarchy will cause unexpected failures.

### The Rendering Pipeline

Most web applications specify their user interface using the markup of a particular programming language. For Ember.js, we've done the work to make templates written using the Handlebars templating language automatically update when the values used inside of them are changed.

While the process of displaying a template is automatic for developers, under the hood there are a series of steps that must be taken to go from the original template to the final, live DOM representation that the user sees.

#### 1. Template Compilation

The application's templates are loaded over the network or as part of the application payload in string form. When the application loads, it sends the template string to Handlebars to be compiled into a function. Once compiled, the template function is saved, and can be used by multiple views repeatedly, each time they need to re-render.

This step may be omitted in applications where the templates are pre-compiled on the server. In those cases, the template is transferred not as the original, human-readable template string but as a the compiled code.
