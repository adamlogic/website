## Getting Started

Depending on your needs, there are several ways to get started creating your 
first Ember.js app.

If your needs are simple or you're interested in just playing around, you can 
download the Ember.js Starter Kit. The Starter Kit is based on [HTML5 
Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and does not require any build tools 
or other dependencies. To begin, download the Starter Kit and unzip it. You can 
edit the Handlebars templates directly inside the `index.html` file, and the 
Ember.js app itself lives in `javascripts/app.js`.

For larger apps, you may want to consider using Ruby on Rails. Rails helps you 
manage your source code and other assets, while also providing the REST API 
that your application will talk to.
