## Getting Started with Ember.js and Ruby on Rails

Before getting started with Ember.js, you should have the latest version of Ruby on Rails installed
(which is 3.2.3 at the time of writing). If you don't already have Ruby on Rails, you can follow
the instructions available on the [Rails website](http://rubyonrails.org/download).

In this guide, we'll show you how to build a simple, personal photoblog application using Ember.js and Ruby on Rails.

### Creating a New Project

Use the `rails` command to generate a new project:

```
rails new photoblog -m http://emberjs.com/template.rb
```

The -m option specifies a template on which to base your new project. We have provided one for Ember.js apps which does the following:

* Loads the ember-rails and active_model_serializers gems
* Runs `bundle install`
* Generates an appropriate ember directory structure inside app/assets/javascripts/ember
* Generates an AssetsController and supplies an appropriate route in order to serve your application
* Generates an appropirate ApplicationSerializer for your applications data models.
  
When rails has finished creating your application it will reside in the `photoblog` directory. Switch to this newly created directory:

```
cd photoblog
```

### Creating our First Controller

Controllers serve as a mediator between your views and models. You can create a new controller using the `ember:controller` generator.

If your controller will be representing multiple objects, you should create an `Ember.ArrayController`. Let's create a new array controller to manage our photos by invoking the generator with the `--array` option:

```
rails g ember:controller photos --array
```

This will generate a new array controller called `Photoblog.photosController` inside the `app/assets/javascripts/ember/controllers/photos_controller.js` file. Note that this file also creates a class called `Photoblog.PhotosController`. This allows you to easily create new instances of the controller for unit testing without having to reset singletons to their original state.
